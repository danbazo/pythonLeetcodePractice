# Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons (LeetCode #452)
**Difficulty: Medium"


There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array points where points[i] = [xstart, xend] denotes a balloon whose horizontal diameter stretches between xstart and xend. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.

Arrows can be shot up directly vertically (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with xstart and xend is burst by an arrow shot at x if xstart <= x <= xend. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.

Given the array points, return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.

 

### Example 1:

**Input:** points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons [10,16] and [7,12].
### Example 2:

**Input:** points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** One arrow needs to be shot for each balloon for a total of 4 arrows.
### Example 3:

**Input:** points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 2, bursting the balloons [1,2] and [2,3].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 4, bursting the balloons [3,4] and [4,5].
 

### Constraints:

1 <= points.length <= 105

points[i].length == 2

-231 <= xstart < xend <= 231 - 1

## Solution:
- Sort intervals (points) based on their starting coordinate to process from left to right.
- Track current overlap region: Start with the end of the first balloon.
- Iterate over sorted balloons:
  - If the current balloon starts before or at the end of the overlap, narrow the overlap.
  - If it starts after the overlap ends, increment arrow count and update the overlap to the current balloon's range.
- Return total number of arrows needed.
## Time Complexity:
- O(n log n) â€” for sorting the intervals.
