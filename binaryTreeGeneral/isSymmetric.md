Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

 

Example 1:
![symtree1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70ea61dc-ca52-4f36-82a3-7957c100a6f0)


Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
Output: true
Example 2:
![symtree2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27c5d031-2d4a-465e-85d6-cd8006d713bb)


Input: root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]
Output: false
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
