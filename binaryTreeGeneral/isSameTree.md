Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

 

Example 1:
![ex1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef06e118-7610-4dff-b534-e8b487d4515b)


Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true
Example 2:
![ex2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a080f02c-aae9-42ba-b4cb-bbf675fbdb20)


Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false
Example 3:

![ex3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3aa171b8-8d37-45ef-a191-da140f303dcd)

Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].
-104 <= Node.val <= 104
